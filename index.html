  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="a">
    <p>
      You've made your way to this page to hear about the outstanding family of the Berger. A two parent household, with a florishing binding marriage. There are 4 of us, in my household at least, and were a very tight pack. We all have our own unique set of
      sklls and help each other out when we can. Yeah we fight like every family, but we do not let it ever get the best of us and at the end of it were all going to laugh. Competitive in win or defeat we are always there to push each others limits and
      help them grow into a better person. Anyone would love to switch parents if they could, to feel all the love give to their children in everything they say and do. With all the luck given to me, it is great to say, this is my family.
