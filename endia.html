  <h2>Stubburn but Beautiful: Endia Berger</h2>
    <div class=a>
  <p>
    She how beautiful black can be! She is a smart girl trying to test her boundaries and learning from her mistakes. She take after both parents, recruiting our mom as her best friend, and stealing our dad's sense of humor when it comes to joking background.
    She has always been the center of attention ever since birth and continues to be so. Taking after her brother, she is talented on the track. I am happy to know that she is not as introverted as me, not that i did not have friends, but this is about her.
    I just hope she stays on the right path, and keeps her bible with her.
